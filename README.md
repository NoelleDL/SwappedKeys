# Swapped Keys

Two keys on a calculator have been switched resulting in the following incorrect arithmetic expressions. The outputs are correct but the inputs are incorrect.

123    = 3

8423   = 252

4+4    = 8

4*7-10 = 417

9/3    = 3

42-9   = -36

Write some code to determine which of the following keys have been switched:
`1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, +, -, /, *`
